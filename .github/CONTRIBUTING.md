# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is a static site (no build). Please:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Keep changes focused and small
3. Run lint and tests locally (`npm run lint && npm test`)
4. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots if UI changes

Guidelines:
- Keep vanilla JS, HTML, CSS (no runtime frameworks)
- Maintain accessibility (labels, keyboard, focus)
- Preserve GitHub Pages deployment from repository root
- Add tests for game logic changes
